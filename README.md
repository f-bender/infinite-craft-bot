# Infinite Craft Bot

A bot for automatically crafting, and afterwards querying full recipes of found elements of the
[neal.fun Infinite Craft game](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/).

The directory/package structure of this project loosely follows the one by [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
(though poetry is used for dependency management).
